<p>It was a quarter to eight on the evening of August 15, 2023, when Professor Zhou Deyi and I ‎arrived at the sprawling Wuchang Railway Station, ready to embark on our overnight 16-hour ‎train ride to Longnan. We had arrived nearly 2 hours early, giving us time to soak in the ‎atmosphere as throngs of passengers flooded the station. Our excitement was palpable - after ‎months of planning, we were finally embarking on this monumental trip.‎<br>Professor Zhou and I passed the time observing the scenes around us and engaging in thought-‎provoking discussions about his philosophies on advancing rural development in China. He was ‎always ready with insightful perspectives.‎</p>



<p>As departure time crept closer, Professor Zhou broke unsettling news to me: due to ‎overwhelming crowds, we may have to make do with hard seats for this long overnight journey. ‎This prospect shocked me, while the well-traveled Professor Zhou took it in stride, having ‎already anticipated this possibility. As seasoned voyagers, we knew discomfort was merely part ‎of the adventure that lay ahead this night. ‎<br>Soon after, Chen Zhilin and Li Gen joined us on the station. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_0643.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-851" /></figure>



<p>The train was overflowing with ‎passengers, some even resorting to sitting on the ground near the tracks. Being a local route, ‎comfort was clearly not a priority.‎ We squeezed into the hard seats, dismayed by the prospect of 14 hours in these cramped ‎quarters. The crowds showed no sign of thinning as the train departed. We strategized to ‎maximize our discomfort, taking turns resting our heads on the lone dinner table between the ‎seats to catch a few winks.‎</p>

<p>Exhausted as I was, the contorted sleeping positions afforded little actual rest. By 7am, we ‎finally secured the coveted hard sleeper berths. "I may have already lost the sleep," Professor ‎Zhou wryly observed, echoing our collective sentiment. I managed a luxurious five-hour nap, ‎capitalizing on the newfound comfort.‎<br>Fourteen hours later, we arrived in Guangyuan, a city in Sichuan Province. After a quick lunch, ‎we boarded a shorter, 90-minute train to Longnan. Stepping out of the modest station, we were ‎immediately struck by Longnan's idyllic surroundings, a world away from Wuhan's hustle and ‎bustle. Nestled amongst towering mountains, Longnan exuded a sense of serenity. Unlike ‎Wuhan's humid hangover, the air here felt crisp and clean.‎</p>

<p><br>With Professor Zhou invited to an official dinner, Chen, Li and I seized the opportunity to ‎explore the captivating Longnan River. Strolling along the paved riverbanks, lined with lush ‎green trees, was serenely picturesque. The city skyline provided a panoramic view from across ‎the river, underscoring Longnan's unique integration of natural and urban beauty. The city's ‎laidback tempo and parks interwoven with urban development gave Longnan an atmosphere ‎unlike any other city I'd visited in China. After having cooped up in a train for so many hours, ‎stretching our legs along the tranquil river was the perfect way to decompress.‎</p>

<p><br>At night, we were joined by a local friend for dinner. We later retreated to the hotel, reflecting ‎on the sights and insights gleaned from the our momentous journey thus far.‎</p>



<p><strong>Day 1: Industrial Visits and Experiential Learning in Wudu, Longnan</strong></p>



<p>On the morning of August 17th, our delegation, meticulously organized by the joint efforts of our CBEC team and Longnan E-commerce Bureau, convened in Wudu, Longnan. We were a team of 26, representing 17 distinct universities and enterprises. Accompanying us were Wang Runxue, Deputy Director of Longnan City E-commerce Development Bureau, and Wang Xue, Deputy Director of the E-commerce Center in Wudu District.</p>



<p><strong><em>Xiangyu Olive Oil Processing Factory</em></strong><br>Our day started with a visit to the Xiangyu Olive Oil Processing Factory, established in 1997 as China’s largest full-chain olive oil enterprise. Wang Runxue, Deputy Director of the Longnan City E-commerce Development Bureau, served as our guide. The factory is not only a leader in olive oil but has diversified into six major product lines including health supplements, skincare products, olive wood art, beverages, and snacks. Its product, Xiangyu Olive Mingui Soft Capsules, fills a domestic gap in oil-based health supplements and has received a national invention patent. The factory has garnered over 220 national and provincial honors and has twice been invited to participate in drafting national standards for olive oil. Their products have won 62 gold medals in international olive oil competitions in Spain, Greece, and Italy, and are exported to multiple countries. The visit culminated in a tasting session of their award-winning olive oil and tea, captured by a group photograph.</p>

<p><strong><em>Unconventional Visit to Mountain-Based Chicken Farm</em></strong></p>



<p>The day's itinerary took a turn for the unconventional as we visited a mountain-based chicken farm that also serves as a quasi-zoo. Managed by Mr. Zhang Qian and popularly known by the online moniker "Chicken Commander" (鸡司令), the farm is home to a diverse array of animals, including ostriches and Tibetan buffalo.</p>



<p>Beyond the livestock, what makes this farm stand out is its robust digital presence. The farm has garnered substantial attention on Douyin, China’s equivalent of TikTok, thanks to innovative live selling sessions conducted by Mr. Zhang. But the true star of these online interactions is a particular breed of chicken called "Guifei Chicken," cared for by a young farmer named Shang Yukang. He regularly livestreams the daily life and quirks of these chickens, sharing amusing anecdotes with an engaged online audience. The demand for both the chickens and their eggs has exceeded supply, as many viewers place orders after being captivated by Shang's storytelling.</p>



<p>Shang Yukang has also established the Cheng County Guifei Poultry Farming Cooperative. This cooperative aims to distribute chicken seedlings uniformly, provide feed and technical support, and manage waste effectively. Most importantly, the cooperative has empowered dozens of impoverished households in the surrounding areas by providing them with a sustainable means of income, contributing to poverty alleviation in the region.</p>



<p>This unconventional visit offered a unique perspective on how traditional farming practices can be revolutionized by leveraging modern digital marketing strategies. It also served as a vivid example of how e-commerce and social media can make a tangible difference in rural development and poverty alleviation.</p>

<p><strong><em>Conference Attendance</em></strong></p>



<p>The conference was attended by approximately 60 delegates, representing 17 universities and enterprises, including Alibaba International and several county-level e-commerce centers. The forum concluded with the signing of teaching and internship agreements, further cementing the collaborative ethos.</p>



<p>This conference not only acted as a platform for intellectual exchange but also served as a catalyst for actionable initiatives, leaving a lasting impression on all attendees.</p>



<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>



<p>The Longnan e-commerce landscape presents a compelling case study of how digital transformation can catalyze rural revitalization and economic development. The city's multi-tiered approach in building e-commerce infrastructure, from centralized hubs to rural service stations, highlights the scalability and adaptability of e-commerce as an economic engine. These findings align with the observations made during the forum where we examined the e-commerce initiatives of Longnan. The forum visits further substantiated the role of e-commerce in driving local economies and improving livelihoods, especially in the context of poverty alleviation.</p>



<p>Notably, Longnan's investment in e-commerce has resulted in a multifaceted impact, ranging from significant revenue generation to the elevation of local products on a broader market platform. The city's e-commerce ecosystem has not only helped in boosting sales of agricultural produce but also has had a multiplier effect on related sectors like logistics and human resources development. These observations are consistent with the scholarly discussion that transpired during our forum, specifically on the synergistic relationship between e-commerce and other sectors (Chen et al., 2019).</p>



<p>Longnan’s strategies, such as the development of a three-tier logistics system and the use of live-streaming for marketing, represent innovative solutions to traditional challenges in rural commerce. These strategies were a subject of keen interest during our forum discussions, particularly in the context of how technology can be employed creatively to solve long-standing economic issues.</p>



<p>However, it is crucial to remember that the Longnan model, while impressive, is not without its challenges. Issues like the digital divide and the need for further upskilling of the rural workforce for full e-commerce integration were points of concern discussed at our forum. Future investigations could focus on these areas for a holistic understanding of rural e-commerce development.</p>



<p>The Longnan e-commerce model, as studied in the 6<sup>th</sup> CBEC forum, serves as an illustrative example of how integrated, well-planned digital strategies can lead to sustainable economic development. It confirms that e-commerce can indeed serve as a critical tool in regional economic planning, fostering both growth and inclusivity.</p>
