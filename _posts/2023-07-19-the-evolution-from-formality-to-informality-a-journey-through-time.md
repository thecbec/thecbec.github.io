<p><strong>Retrospective: Past Forums and Trainings</strong></p>



<p>Since the inception of the first Cross-Border E-commerce (CBEC) Forum in 2018, held in Wuhan, we have successfully organized four diverse forums in Wuhan, Faisalabad, Bangladesh, and Jinzhou respectively. In addition, three training projects were undertaken during this period.</p>



<p>In 2018, Huazhong Agricultural University initiated the "Belt and Road" China-Pakistan International Forum on Cross-border E-commerce, focusing on the development of cross-border e-commerce and agricultural digital services. The forum was envisioned as a platform for mutual exchanges between governments, universities, enterprises, associations, and research institutions in countries and regions along the "Belt and Road". The goal was to address the developmental challenges of cross-border e-commerce along the "Belt and Road", particularly the China-Pakistan corridor. The forum facilitated academic discussions and exchanges on cross-border e-commerce and aimed to leverage the resources of overseas students from the two places through universities. This approach was designed to address the trust deficit in cross-border e-commerce transactions, thereby improving their efficiency.</p>



<p>This journey of collaboration and mutual learning has been supported immensely by our friends, students, and colleagues, including Rizwan, Azka, Amar, Wangqing, Liteng, Liang Wanqi, Saqib, Lacina, and countless others. We have devoted significant resources to this initiative, and the outcomes have been gratifying. The largest endeavor was made in 2022, where we invested 150,000 RMB in the ecommerce and micro-finance experiment in Kenya and the training in Pakistan. In 2023, Huazhong Agricultural University and Karakoram International University jointly launched the "2023 6th 'Belt and Road' Cross-border E-commerce International Forum", marking another significant milestone in our journey. However, this is only the beginning of a long journey towards enhancing cross-border e-commerce efficiency and fostering international collaborations. Following is a pictorial review of some of our significant activities.</p>

<p><strong>Prospects for Future Cooperation</strong></p>



<p>Moving forward, our focus will shift towards more pragmatic actions rather than mere discussions. In 2023, we aspire to make substantial strides in the micro-finance sector in Kenya. Our vision extends to promoting the use of ecommerce for small and sustainable agricultural tools and machinery in Mozambique, Pakistan, and Southeast Asian countries. This initiative aims to aid small farmers in improving productivity, environmental protection, and poverty alleviation.</p>



<p>In a step towards this direction, this year's forum is co-hosted by Huazhong Agricultural University, Kashgar Regional Bureau of Commerce, and Longnan E-Commerce Development Bureau. We're fortunate to receive additional support from co-organizers and sponsors including Karakoram International University and Kashi University. The forum is designed as a platform for academic discussions and deliberations on cross-border e-commerce, particularly focusing on cooperation in Kashgar and its neighboring regions. We're committed to leveraging the potential of overseas students through universities, to bridge the trust deficit in cross-border e-commerce. This collective effort is aimed at enhancing the efficiency of cross-border transactions in the relevant regions.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<strong>Ensuring Forum Sustainability: Proposing a Shift in Approach</strong></p>



<p>With respect to the forums, we are open to someone taking over and continuing in the formal manner. However, if this does not materialize, I propose a shift from our conventional methods. Instead of formal forums, we could cultivate more informal and engaging interactions among youth in a 'club' setting, built around shared interests.</p>



<p>In 2023, I have embarked on a personal short video program on Today’s Headlines. We also have the 'Bulletin of International Supply Chain Innovation' journal, which could serve as a platform to document our achievements through videos, pictures, and short essays.</p>



<p>Possible future initiatives include an informal annual forum at the end of the year to share our progress and achievements. We could also leverage our WeChat group for impromptu video meetings as needed.</p>



<p>I urge all participants to contribute their unique insights and ideas to ensure the sustainability of the forum.</p>



<p>In closing, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to everyone for their contributions over the past five years.</p>



<p>Wishing you all the best!</p>
