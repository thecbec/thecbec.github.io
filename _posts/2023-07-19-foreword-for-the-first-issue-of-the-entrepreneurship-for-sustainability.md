<p>In an era of accelerated industrialization and rising global income, the planet has seen a staggering increase in the production and consumption of non-degradable goods. These products, crafted under high temperatures and pressures, are resistant to natural decomposition, thus amassing in our environment post-use. The mounting pollution from these goods poses a formidable challenge to humanity, one for which a solution remains elusive. The irony lies in the fact that human progress itself has become a harbinger of potential self-destruction.</p>



<p>Moreover, intense competition, both at individual and national levels, exacerbates this issue by driving the scales of production and pollution to alarming heights, suggesting an unavoidable future trajectory.</p>



<p>Remarkably, we live in a world characterized by stark paradoxes: the coexistence of abject poverty and wasteful consumption, rampant unemployment juxtaposed with overproduction, and the stark divide between affluent and impoverished nations.</p>



<p>Our planet, unique in its vast expanses of water and a protective atmosphere that maintains a stable, mild temperature, stands as a bastion of life in the universe. This atmosphere shields us from harmful ultraviolet rays, facilitating the evolution of life. Despite enduring countless disasters over eons, it has shaped an environment where humans could thrive. As of now, we've yet to discover an alternate planet that could sustain life as Earth does. Having endured for billions of years, the Earth now faces the threat of severe damage within mere centuries due to our increasingly indulgent lifestyles.</p>



<p>Out of all life forms, humans are uniquely positioned to shoulder the responsibility of safeguarding the Earth.</p>



<p>As the world shrinks under the influence of economic globalization, the international supply chain and network govern the distribution and production of materials. Innovations within these supply chains could offer potential solutions to offset the effects of our global production and consumption patterns. Although such changes may not wholly achieve sustainability, they constitute an essential step towards it.</p>



<p>This journal seeks to serve as a repository for explorations and endeavors in this direction. We welcome all contributions, whether they're news, narratives, or analyses rooted in economic logic. Each year, we will acknowledge the most innovative solutions and breakthroughs from our pool of publications, highlighting them with certificates of excellence.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the journal aims to foster a community of like-minded individuals dedicated to environmental protection and social sustainability. An annual forum will provide a platform for sharing stories, insights, and perspectives related to these vital themes.</p>



<p>We extend an invitation to you all, hoping that our collective efforts can bring about meaningful change. We look forward to having more and more people join us on this significant journey.</p>
