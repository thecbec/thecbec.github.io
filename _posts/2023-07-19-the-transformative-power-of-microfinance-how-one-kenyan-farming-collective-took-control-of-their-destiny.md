<p>Broad Vision is a collective of farmers from Kimandi village, located in Gatanga constituency, Murang’a County, Kenya. Their story, spanning from 2013 to the present, is a testament to the transformative power of microfinance and community-led initiatives in driving rural development and fostering self-reliance.</p>



<p>In 2013, one Broad Vision member received a grant of Kshs. 25,000, which was invested in rabbit rearing. However, the venture encountered challenges due to disease and predation. Undeterred, the members continued to explore other avenues.</p>



<p>The turning point arrived on December 24, 2014, when Professor Zhou Deyi from China visited Kenya. During his visit, Broad Vision members received a microfinance grant, which was equally divided among them. Each member received Kshs.9,000, which became the seed money for various small-scale farming ventures.</p>

<p>The ventures ranged from growing seedlings, rearing livestock, to growing horticultural fruits. Despite initial success, some members shifted their focus to dairy farming due to market fluctuations. One member even started a successful cosmetic shop from the profits of chicken rearing.</p>



<p>In another success story, a member utilized a grant of Kshs. 65,000 to start a utensil-selling business. Although the business was initially affected by COVID-19 related movement restrictions, the member strategically invested the profits in purchasing a plot of land, thereby expanding their asset portfolio.</p>



<p>Recognizing the importance of collective saving, Broad Vision members agreed to save Kshs. 200 per month. This fund facilitated the purchase of organic manure, which significantly boosted their farming activities. Moreover, the group collectively grew avocado seedlings, which have recently started yielding fruits.</p>



<p>Broad Vision's activities expanded beyond individual ventures. Their collective savings have allowed them to purchase a piece of land, on which they have planted sunflowers. Their future vision includes buying an oil press machine to extract sunflower oil, which will provide a new source of income and encourage more local farmers to plant sunflowers.</p>



<p>Broad Vision has thus set a clear path forward for its future endeavors. As a collective, the group aims to secure the best possible market prices to maximize their profit. After each sale, they plan to begin making partial repayments on their loans, demonstrating a sustainable approach to their development strategy and a commitment to financial responsibility. This strategy not only ensures the group's continued growth but also strengthens the case for similar microfinance initiatives elsewhere.</p>



<p>The experience of Broad Vision illustrates the potential of microfinance to empower farming communities, enabling them to diversify their income sources, improve their living standards, and foster a spirit of collective action and self-reliance. Their success provides valuable insights for similar initiatives in other rural areas around the world.</p>
