<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted physical gatherings in 2020, Professor Zhou spearheaded innovative adaptations by organizing the third forum entirely online in collaboration with partners in Bangladesh. Meticulous planning ensured the 4 hour agenda seamlessly connected over 100 diverse participants across 7 interactive sessions on emerging e-commerce topics.</p>



<p>The forum focused on the potential of CBEC to foster international cooperation and development. Participants discussed the opportunities and challenges of CBEC, sharing their experiences and insights. The discussions underscored the importance of research and training in promoting CBEC and highlighted the potential of e-commerce to drive economic development in Belt and Road countries.</p>



<p>The team demonstrated agility in setting up sessions customized for Bangladesh by involving their universities. Local experts presented on niche areas like factors influencing e-commerce adoption and women-led e-commerce initiatives, enriching discussions. Participants from China, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Mongolia, Kenya and Egypt shared experiences and ideas across time zones.</p>



<p>Despite the uncertainty posed by the pandemic, the team's commitment shone through their detailed proposals for 2021 activities like training programs and joint research projects. Their perseverance ensured the disruptions did not deter the forum's progress.</p>



<p>The forum also facilitated the establishment of partnerships for future collaboration. Participants, particularly from Bangladesh, expressed interest in partnering with Chinese institutions for research and training in e-commerce. These partnerships promised to offer mutual benefits, promoting knowledge exchange and capacity building in e-commerce.</p>
