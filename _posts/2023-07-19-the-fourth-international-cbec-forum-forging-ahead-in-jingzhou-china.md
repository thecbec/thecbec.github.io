<p>The return of the in-person forum in Jingzhou, China in December 2021 after pandemic disruptions reflected Professor Zhou's inspirational leadership in guiding the team through uncertainties. His efforts fostered the team's unity and contribution, despite members being spread across China and Pakistan.</p>



<p>In line with emerging needs, discussions centered on how CBEC could address food security challenges and the impacts of COVID-19. Dedicated planning by Professor Zhou resulted in engaging sessions like the academic discussion on supply chain research and the business session where e-commerce enterprises shared case studies.</p>



<p>One of the key outcomes of the forum was the establishment of the Belt and Road Center for Rice Technology Extension and Training (BRC-Rice). This center aims to promote research and training in rice technology, with the ultimate goal of enhancing food security in Belt and Road countries.</p>



<p>The team also displayed commitment to introspect and improve further. They identified key challenges faced such as communication gaps and limitations of virtual collaboration. This demonstrated their maturity to learn from setbacks. Under Professor Zhou's guidance, the team reached greater clarity on working together for upcoming forums.</p>
