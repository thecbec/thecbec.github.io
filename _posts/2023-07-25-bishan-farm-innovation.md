<p>Bishan Farm, located in Hubei Province, China, was founded by Professor Zhou Deyi of Huazhong Agricultural University as a training and research base. The farm raises free-range animals and collects local products for sale to urban consumers.</p>

<p>However, high labor requirements in animal production and lack of trust in product genuineness are challenges. As a result, farmland is underutilized, causing environmental issues, and many rural residents lack job opportunities.</p>



<p>To address these issues, the Bishan Farm team aims to implement the following innovative digital solutions:</p>



<ul>
<li>GPS locators and e-fences to prevent free-range animals from wandering</li>



<li>Automatic gates to open/close animal enclosures</li>



<li>Webcams for remote animal monitoring and rural-urban communication</li>



<li>Automatic mosquito control systems</li>



<li>Automated feeding machines and drinking troughs</li>



<li>Remote broadcast system to call animals back for daily feeding</li>



<li>Blockchain-based traceability system to record product origins and ensure genuineness</li>



<li>Group e-commerce system to facilitate transactions between rural producers and urban consumers</li>
</ul>



<p>The project was submitted to the UN FAO's Global AgriInno Challenge 2021 competition to showcase innovative digital solutions for agriculture. By expanding production and sales, the project intends to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Reduce labor costs and increase productivity</li>



<li>Provide job opportunities for rural women and elders</li>



<li>Use rice straw for feed instead of burning it</li>



<li>Produce healthier food for citizens</li>



<li>Provide internships for local and international youth</li>
</ul>



<p>In closing, the Bishan Farm project aims to benefit rural communities through innovative technology integration, ensuring sustainable and safe food production while connecting smallholder farmers to urban markets.</p>
