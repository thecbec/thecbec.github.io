<p>The International Cross-Border E-commerce (CBEC) Forum was first launched in 2018 by the College of Economics and Management at Huazhong Agricultural University in Wuhan, China. Since then, six forums have been successfully organized in collaboration with universities and institutions from China, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, including the University of Agriculture Faisalabad in Pakistan and Bangladesh Agricultural University in Mymensingh.</p>



<p>These forums have brought together researchers, academics, and business professionals from various countries along the Belt and Road Initiative to discuss the development, challenges, and opportunities of cross-border e-commerce. The forums have yielded significant outcomes, such as the establishment of the CBEC Research Group, the launch of micro-finance projects in Kenya and Pakistan, and the promotion of e-commerce cooperation between China and participating countries. </p>



<p>Building on the success of previous forums, the 7th International Cross-Border E-commerce Forum aims to promote sustainable micro-finance initiatives, launch the DD Fund, and encourage e-commerce cooperation and communication between China and Bangladesh. Organized by the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB) in Dhaka, in collaboration with Huazhong Agricultural University, the forum provides a platform for academic discussions, knowledge sharing, and collaboration among universities, businesses, and government organizations to tackle the challenges and opportunities in cross-border e-commerce development.</p>
