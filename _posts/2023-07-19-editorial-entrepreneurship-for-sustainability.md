<p>Friends and Colleagues,</p>



<p>It is with great excitement that I present this inaugural issue of Entrepreneurship Sustainability. As a pioneering “free style journal,” we embrace diversity of thought, background, and expression. What binds our community is a shared spirit of intellectual curiosity, social responsibility, and bold vision.</p>



<p>The pages ahead showcase contributions primarily from our core team members and long-time collaborators across various countries. In future issues, we hope to publish submissions from our forums and expand authorship to a broader range of stakeholders, including past and future participants, students, businesspeople, academics, and others enthusiastic about ecommerce and sustainability.</p>



<p>This first issue captures the collaborative spirit of our community in many forms—from formal research to informal musings, quantitative data to qualitative narratives, scholarly analysis alongside authentic voices from the field. We believe broad participation across disciplines advances understanding.</p>



<p>Our common purpose also shines through the eclectic mix of contents. Despite disparate styles and subjects, all contributions share a commitment to blending entrepreneurial innovation with social and environmental sustainability. This synthesis is essential as humanity navigates profound technological and societal transformations.</p>



<p>As editor, curating this issue provided inspiring reminders of the meaningful work we undertake together. Memorable moments from past forums and field studies came flooding back, reminding me of the passion and dedication of our community. I am honored and humbled to participate in this journey with you all.</p>



<p>Looking forward, I envision this journal will chronicle the ongoing growth of our community. May we continue learning from each other, pushing boundaries, and translating ideas into positive impact. Many challenges lie ahead, but united by audacious hope and concrete action, we will build a more just, resilient, and enriching world.</p>



<p>Onward!</p>
