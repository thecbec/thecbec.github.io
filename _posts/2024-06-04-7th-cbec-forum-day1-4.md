<p>The 7th International Cross-Border E-commerce Forum (CBEC) 2024, co-hosted by University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB) and Huazhong Agricultural University, commenced on May 30th, 2024 at the ULAB campus in Dhaka. The forum aimed to promote sustainable micro-finance initiatives, launch the YOU Fund, and strengthen e-commerce cooperation between China and Bangladesh. The event brought together researchers, academics, business professionals, and key stakeholders from China, Bangladesh, and other countries along the Belt and Road Initiative.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Day 1 – 3 (May 28 - 30, 2024): Arrival, Preparation, and Welcome</strong></h2>



<p>The Chinese delegation, including Professor Zhou Deyi, Chen Zhilin, Li Gen, and Zhou Zhaowen, arrived in Dhaka on May 28th, 2024. Despite long-term planning and tireless efforts to secure visas, Dr. Amar Razzaq and Saqib Khan were unable to join the forum in person due to visa issues. However, they actively participated in the event through online platforms and contributed to the organization and planning of the forum.</p>



<p>Upon arrival, Chen Zhilin, Li Gen, and Zhou Zhaowen encountered an unexpected challenge at the airport. Due to a language barrier and incomplete documentation, they were stuck at the airport for three hours while attempting to obtain visas on arrival. Despite this setback, the delegation remained in good spirits and looked forward to the upcoming events.</p>



<p>In the evening of May 28th, the Chinese delegation enjoyed a warm welcome and the dinner with Dr. Jude, Dr. Kader, and two other colleagues from ULAB. The dinner provided an opportunity for the participants to get acquainted, discuss the forum's agenda, and build rapport before the official commencement of the event.</p>



<p>Prof. Geoffrey Gathungu arrived in Dhaka from Kenya in the early hours of May 29 to join the delegation. Then, on the morning of May 29th, the delegation visited the New Market, a local wholesale market in Dhaka. This visit allowed the participants to gain insights into the local economy, observe the bustling trade activities, and understand the potential for cross-border e-commerce in the region. In the afternoon, the delegation had the privilege of meeting with the Vice-Chancellor and the Dean of the Business School at ULAB. These meetings laid the groundwork for further collaboration and strengthened the partnership between Huazhong Agricultural University and ULAB.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Overview of Rural E-commerce in China and CBEC Initiative by Dr. Amar Razzaq</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Amar Razzaq, Associate Professor at Huanggang Normal University, presented a comprehensive overview of the rural e-commerce landscape in China and the CBEC initiative. He began by highlighting the significant growth of e-commerce in rural areas, with an internet penetration rate of 34% (accounting for 26.7% of total internet users) and rural online retail sales exceeding 143 billion US$ (17.4% of total retail sales). Dr. Razzaq also noted that agricultural products online retail sales reached 30.7 billion US$, accounting for about 18% of total rural retail sales.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">

</figure>



<p>Dr. Razzaq then introduced the "Taobao Village" model, a government and Alibaba-backed initiative aimed at promoting e-commerce in rural areas. He explained that a Taobao Village is characterized by residents spontaneously engaging in e-commerce primarily through the Taobao Marketplace, with a total annual e-commerce transaction volume of at least RMB 10 million (~US$ 1.43 million) and at least 10% of village households actively participating in e-commerce or having at least 100 active online shops. Dr. Razzaq emphasized the success of the Taobao Village model in catalyzing industry clusters in rural areas.</p>



<p>Moving on to the history of the CBEC initiative, Dr. Razzaq provided a detailed timeline of events and activities from 2016 to the present.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Kenyan Micro-finance Project Progress Report by Geoffrey K. Gathungu</strong></h2>



<p>Geoffrey K. Gathungu, Associate Professor at Chuka University in Kenya, presented a detailed account of the micro-finance initiative in Kenya. He began by discussing the importance of agriculture in Kenya as a key driver of poverty alleviation, employment, income generation, GDP growth, foreign exchange earnings, and food security. However, he noted that agricultural productivity is lagging behind due to poor financing, especially for small-scale farmers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/weixin-image_20240531125448.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1098" /></figure>



<p>Professor Gathungu highlighted the critical role of microfinance institutions in enhancing the production and productivity of smallholder farmers by providing them with the necessary financial resources. He explained how microfinance can be used to provide small-scale and low-cost agricultural machines, acquire agricultural inputs like seeds and fertilizers, and facilitate post-harvest value addition.</p>



<p>Despite the potential benefits of microfinance, Professor Gathungu noted that the adoption and utilization of microfinance credit in smallholder farming systems fall short due to challenges such as the administrative complexity of small loans and the lack of necessary collateral. He emphasized that smallholder farmers are crucial contributors to agricultural and economic development in developing countries, making their access to credit a top priority.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/img_8186.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1102" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/img_8212.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1101" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/img_8216.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1100" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/img_8218-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1103" /></figure>
</figure>



<p>Professor Gathungu then provided an overview of the Kenyan Micro-finance project, which started in August 2013 in the Kimandi village of Gatanga District, Murang'a County. The project initially lent USD 800 to two farmers for raising rabbits and making charcoal. In December 2014, an additional USD 1000 was released to the Broad Vision Group, led by Joseph Maina Gitao, and distributed among 10 members of the group as a revolving fund.</p>



<p>The projects implemented by the group included seedlings (avocado, ribena, cypress, cabbages) and consumables like fertilizers, insecticides, polythene, manure, and labor, as well as hotel, courgette farming, bull rearing, and poultry (hen) businesses. However, the farmers faced challenges such as the death of chickens due to diseases and pests, drought affecting crop growth, and difficulty in buying chicken feed.</p>



<p>Despite these challenges, some farmers reported profits, such as the bull project, which generated KSh 57,600 used to rebuild a cow shed, construct a feeding trough, and a table for cutting napier grass. The hotel business owner reported that they would repay the debt within 1 year and 3 months while maintaining a stable business and paying two assistants.</p>



<p>Professor Gathungu also shared his personal experience with microfinance, both as a researcher at the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) and as a lecturer at Chuka University. He discussed the establishment of the Plant Science Investment group at Chuka University, which provided loans to members and non-members at different interest rates.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/weixin-image_20240604153059.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1105" /></figure>



<p>In 2018, Professor Gathungu attended the 1st Cross Border E-Commerce Forum at Huazhong Agricultural University in Wuhan, China, where discussions were held on visiting the Broad Vision SHG in Kimandi, Gatanga County, to address the issues of refunding and circulation of funds. Chuka University visited the group in 2022, provided training on available opportunities, and conducted a survey on the effect of microfinance on the adoption of small farm equipment.</p>



<p>Following consultations with Professor Zhou Deyi, a funding of 50,000 CNY (approximately KSh 952,970) was provided in April 2022. A portion of the funds (KSh 350,000) was used for logistical support in conducting surveys in Broad Vision SHG and four other farmer groups in Chuka, Tharaka Nithi County. The remaining funds (KSh 600,000) were used for lending to small-scale farmers in the form of equipment/inputs rather than cash loans.</p>



<p>Professor Gathungu shared the findings of a study conducted in Gatanga Muranga County and Chuka Tharaka Nithi County, which assessed the role of microfinance credit access and uptake in relation to the adoption of small agricultural machinery. The study found that factors such as farming experience, gender of the household head, number of enterprises, yield per unit area, years of schooling, household size, organization membership, access to extension services, and collateral availability significantly influenced microfinance credit uptake.</p>



<p>The Chuka University microfinance project has opened a joint account managed by three researchers to ensure accountability and transparency. As of October 2023, the project has loaned funds to three business people: a groceries saleslady, a foodstuff shopkeeper, and an electronic shop owner. Loans are to be repaid within 5 months with interest rates ranging from 2.75-5% per month.</p>



<p>Professor Gathungu concluded his presentation by sharing lessons learned from the microfinance project, including the need to work with farmers, the importance of collaboration at all levels, the effectiveness of lending inputs instead of cash, the significance of conservation of nature, the role of culture in microfinance uptake, the need for government involvement in agricultural policy, the challenges of operating in rural areas, the importance of flexible repayment schedules, and the benefits of pairing microfinance credit with agriculture trainings.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pakistani Micro-finance Project Progress Report by Saqib Khan</strong></h2>



<p>Saqib Khan, a PhD candidate at Huazhong University of Science and Technology and the key member of the CBEC team, presented the progress report on the Pakistani micro-finance project, focusing on the Cattle Fattening Project (In fact, Professor Zhou presented on behalf of Saqib as he had to deal with something else at that time). The project aims to empower small-scale farmers in Pakistan by providing them with microfinancing through the YOU Fund to purchase cattle for fattening ahead of the Eid al Adha (Festival of Sacrifice).</p>



<p>The project's financial structure allocates 50% of the profit to the participating farmer, reinvests 30% to purchase more cattle and finance additional farmers, and uses 20% to cover administration costs. A total of 962,500 PKR (approximately 25,000 Chinese Yuan) was allocated for the project, with 59% of the funds (567,800 PKR) utilized so far.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/weixin-image_20240531132241.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1111" /></figure>

</figure>



<p>In the current year, the project selected two farmers, Imran and Imam Bakhsh, and provided each with financing to purchase two bulls. The project manager ensures that the animals are properly fed, arranges timely vaccinations, and conducts regular visits. The farmers are responsible for feeding and caring for the cattle for 6-9 months before selling them at a premium price before the festival.</p>



<p>Mr. Khan reported that the project plans to fully utilize the available funds after the festival and finance more farmers, with an expected fund availability of 1,120,000 PKR, sufficient to buy 10 cattle and finance 5 farmers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Consumer Attention and Market Concentration in E-Commerce by Teng Li, Shaoni Wang, Amar Razzaq, and Deyi Zhou</strong></h2>



<p>Teng Li, a double degree PhD candidate at Huazhong Agricultural University and University of Groningen, Netherlands, presented a study on consumer attention and market concentration in e-commerce using an agent-based modeling approach. The study examined the role of consumer behavior and social influence in driving market concentration, where a small number of firms dominate the market. The presentation included the concepts of attention overload, the impact of social influence on consumer decisions, and strategies for e-commerce businesses to navigate this environment. Teng Li explained that consumers have a limited ability to process all available information about products and sellers, and their decisions are often influenced by recommendations from friends, family, and social media. As a result, a small number of firms with strong brand recognition and online presence tend to dominate the market. Teng Li suggested strategies for e-commerce businesses to navigate this challenging environment, including building strong brands, leveraging social media effectively, and focusing on providing high-quality products and services to gain customer trust and loyalty.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/weixin-image_20240531133347.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1114" /></figure>



<p><strong>Group Photo and Lunch Break</strong></p>



<p>Following the conclusion of the first session, the participants gathered outside the conference hall for a group photograph. After the group photo, the participants proceeded to enjoy a well-deserved lunch break, providing an opportunity for informal networking and further discussions.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/weixin-image_20240531164240-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1124" /></figure>



<p>Prof. Williams then discussed the theme of the forum, "Sustainable E-commerce through New Media and Microfinance Innovations," discussing the need to address the environmental and social impacts of the rapidly growing e-commerce sector. He highlighted the role of new media in promoting sustainability by increasing consumer education and awareness, making companies more transparent and accountable, and fostering community building and support. Prof. Williams cited the example of ULAB's own organic tea brand, Kashi and Kasity, which demonstrates transparency in its production processes and community engagement initiatives.</p>



<p>Moving on to the topic of microfinance, Prof. Williams emphasized its significance in enabling small businesses to adopt sustainable practices and fostering economic diversity and resilience. He acknowledged Bangladesh's prominent role in the microfinance sector, with the pioneering work of Grameen Bank and Nobel Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus. Prof. Williams noted that the majority of businesses in Bangladesh are small and medium-scale enterprises, and microfinance plays a crucial role in supporting their growth and the overall economy. He also highlighted the importance of microfinance in promoting inclusion and equity, empowering marginalized groups such as women and rural entrepreneurs to participate in the digital economy.</p>



<p>Finally, Prof. Williams reaffirmed ULAB's commitment to the principles of sustainability, innovation, and social responsibility, aligning with the values of a liberal arts education. He envisioned a future where the strengths of new media and microfinance are integrated to drive sustainable e-commerce practices, with informed consumer choices, thriving small businesses, and impactful online communities. Prof. Williams called for collaboration among ULAB, Huazhong Agricultural University, and other concerned universities to work towards a more inclusive, equitable, and environmentally friendly digital marketplace.</p>



<p>Prof. Williams' welcome speech set the stage for the forum by highlighting the importance of sustainable e-commerce, the role of new media and microfinance in achieving this goal, and the significance of collaboration between institutions with diverse expertise. His insights emphasized the need for a holistic approach to e-commerce that prioritizes environmental and social responsibility while driving economic growth.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bangladesh Micro-finance Project Progress Report by Kader Muhammad</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Kader Muhammad, a faculty member from the Department of Media Studies and Journalism at ULAB, presented the progress report on the micro-finance project in Bangladesh, which is being implemented in conjunction with the Community Digital Storytelling (CDS) project. He began by providing an overview of the CDS project, explaining that it involves visiting remote areas in Bangladesh and training local community members in digital storytelling techniques using cameras, mobile phones, and other available technology. The aim of the project is to empower these individuals to tell their own stories, express their needs, and share their experiences in their own way.</p>



<p>Dr. Kader emphasized that the CDS project focuses on improving the critical thinking, communication skills, and digital literacy of the participants. He then shared an example of a recent project conducted with the Santal community, one of the largest ethnic communities in Bangladesh, located in the Peerganj area. Dr. Kader and his co-researcher, Dr. Jude, along with their team, visited the community and engaged with the local people, teaching them digital skills and storytelling techniques. The participants included students, working individuals, female football players, and community members who had to discontinue their education due to financial constraints.</p>

</figure>



<p>Dr. Kader then discussed how the micro-finance component was integrated into the CDS project when Professor Zhou Da-Yi introduced the idea. He presented the case of Chanduna, a college student from the Santal community who had to discontinue her education due to financial difficulties and was working as a laborer on other people's farms. Through the micro-finance project, Dr. Kader and his team managed to purchase four cows for Chandona. They also trained her in digital storytelling techniques, which she is now applying within her community.</p>



<p>Dr. Kader acknowledged that the micro-finance project is still in its early stages and that they expect to see results within a year. He highlighted the unique aspect of combining media studies and journalism with micro-finance, empowering the ethnic community members not only with storytelling skills but also with financial support.</p>



<p>During the question and answer session, Dr. Amar Razzaq inquired about the selection process for the beneficiaries of the micro-finance project. Dr. Kader clarified that they choose beneficiaries from the communities they work with in the CDS project, ensuring that the support is directed towards those who need it the most.</p>



<p>Dr. Amar also suggested that Professor Zhou Deyi and Professor Geoffrey from Kenya could have a meeting to exchange ideas and learn from each other's experiences in implementing micro-finance projects, as both Bangladesh and Kenya have significant expertise in this area. He emphasized the importance of collaboration and knowledge sharing, as all the participants are in the initial stages of the YOU Fund micro-finance initiative.</p>



<p>Dr. Kader concluded his presentation by reiterating that the micro-finance project is a work in progress and that they plan to create a documentary showcasing the impact of the initiative once it is completed. He expressed his hope that the combination of digital storytelling and micro-finance will lead to positive progress within the Santal community.</p>



<p>Dr. Kader's presentation highlighted the innovative approach of integrating media studies and micro-finance to empower marginalized communities in Bangladesh. By equipping participants with both digital storytelling skills and financial support, the project aims to create a holistic and sustainable model for community development. The progress report underscored the potential for collaboration and knowledge exchange among different countries and institutions involved in micro-finance initiatives, fostering a global network of support for small-scale farmers and entrepreneurs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Launching Ceremony of the YOU Fund by Zhou Deyi</strong></h2>



<p>Professor Zhou Deyi, founder and CEO of the YOU Fund, delivered an emotionally charged speech during the launching ceremony. He began by posing two profound questions: "Why am I here?" and "What is a good life?" Professor Zhou acknowledged that the answers to these questions might vary among individuals, but he shared his personal perspective and the driving forces behind the creation of the YOU Fund.</p>



<p>From a social standpoint, Professor Zhou emphasized the significance of China's economic rise as the biggest event of the century. He highlighted China's massive population, which surpasses the combined populations of Europe, Japan, America, and Korea, and the country's remarkable achievement of rapid industrialization within a mere 30 years. Professor Zhou noted that China's manufacturing sector now equals the combined capacity of Japan, Germany, and America, generating substantial income for the Chinese people and providing trade opportunities for developing countries that lack strong manufacturing capabilities.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/weixin-image_20240531181128.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1130" /></figure>



<p>Professor Zhou stressed the importance of e-commerce as an efficient means of trade, leveraging IT technology to reduce transaction costs. He observed that in China, a significant portion of the younger generation's expenditure comes from online purchases, as people have grown accustomed to the convenience of buying online. Professor Zhou predicted that e-commerce would become a transformative force in the global economic landscape.</p>



<p>However, Professor Zhou also emphasized that China cannot solely focus on earning money from the rest of the world; it must also give back. While acknowledging the Chinese government's efforts in providing scholarships and donations to other countries, particularly in Africa, he expressed his belief that these initiatives are not always efficient. This realization led him to launch the YOU Fund as a personal initiative, funded from his own pocket, driven by the conviction that it is the right thing to do.</p>



<p>Professor Zhou then explained the personal motivation behind the YOU Fund, sharing a deeply emotional account of his grandfather, Yu Chengyou. With tears in his eyes, Professor Zhou recounted how his grandfather, a hardworking and honest farmer, had suffered greatly throughout his life and had passed away without receiving proper care in his old age. Professor Zhou's voice trembled as he described the profound impact his grandfather had on shaping his personality and worldview, instilling in him a deep appreciation for the qualities of honesty and hard work.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/img_8384.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1132" /></figure>



<p>Composing himself, Professor Zhou explained that the YOU Fund was established to honor his grandfather's memory and to promote the values he embodied. The fund aims to provide microfinance support to small farmers in China, Kenya, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, with an initial seed fund provided by Professor Zhou himself. He expressed his hope that the fund would grow over time, attracting new donations from individuals who share a compassion for all species on Earth.</p>



<p>Professor Zhou emphasized the importance of trust and minimal management costs in the operation of the YOU Fund. He assured the audience that local teams in each country would have full autonomy and decision-making authority in loan management, encouraging them to grow as independent organizations and share their experiences with one another.</p>



<p>Professor Zhou then announced that Dr. Amar Razzaq, an Associate Professor at Huanggang Normal University and a close friend of his, would serve as the Program Manager of the YOU Fund. He explained that Dr. Amar Razzaq's role would involve tracking the progress of the fund, keeping records, and performing program oversight. Professor Zhou expressed his confidence in Dr. Amar Razzaq's abilities, citing his expertise in writing and his position as the Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Entrepreneurship for Sustainability.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/img_8391.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1134" /></figure>



<p>Professor Zhou acknowledged his own busy schedule, which includes managing various aspects of the fund and conducting educational programs at his farm, such as the summer school. He emphasized that appointing Dr. Amar Razzaq as the Program Manager would ensure the efficient management of the YOU Fund and allow for the effective communication of its progress and impact through regular reports and publications in the journal.</p>



<p>Displaying the proposed logos for the YOU Fund, Professor Zhou explained the significance of the Chinese character "友" (you), which represents friendship and is also a homophone for his grandfather's name. He settled on a logo that resembles a farmer, symbolizing the fund's commitment to supporting rural communities.</p>



<p>Professor Zhou concluded his speech by reaffirming his purpose for attending the forum: to promote trade through e-commerce and to advance microfinance initiatives for poverty alleviation and environmental protection. He expressed his belief that the solution for a good life should extend beyond individual or national prosperity; it should encompass the well-being of all species. With a final, emotional appeal, Professor Zhou called upon the audience to join him in this endeavor, working together to create a better world for all.</p>

<p>The launching ceremony of the YOU Fund served as a powerful testament to Professor Zhou's personal dedication and the transformative potential of microfinance in uplifting communities and promoting sustainable development. His heartfelt speech left a lasting impact on the audience, inspiring them to embrace the values of compassion, generosity, and shared responsibility in the pursuit of a good life for all.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Certificate Awarding Ceremony for Microfinance Beneficiaries</strong></h2>



<p>The certificate awarding ceremony was a significant event during the 7th International Cross-Border E-commerce Forum, as it recognized and celebrated the beneficiaries of the YOU Fund (previously known under a different name) since its inception in 2013. The ceremony aimed to commemorate the achievements of the beneficiaries, keep records of their progress, and encourage them to continue their efforts in promoting sustainable development through micro-finance initiatives.</p>



<p>In a unique and environmentally conscious approach, Professor Zhou Deyi, the founder of the YOU Fund, decided to award e-certificates to the beneficiaries, emphasizing the importance of protecting the environment by reducing paper waste. This digital approach to the certificate awarding ceremony aligned with Professor Zhou's philosophy of promoting sustainability and minimizing the environmental impact of human activities.</p>

</figure>



<p>Dr. Amar Razzaq, the newly announced Program Manager of the YOU Fund, conducted the ceremony, inviting representatives from each country to receive the e-certificates on behalf of the beneficiaries. Professor Geoffrey K. Gathungu from Chuka University in Kenya received the e-certificates on behalf of the Kenyan microfinance beneficiaries, who have been actively involved in various agricultural projects and have shown remarkable progress in improving their livelihoods through the support of the YOU Fund.</p>



<p>Dr. Kader Muhammad from the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB) received the e-certificates on behalf of the Bangladeshi microfinance beneficiaries. These beneficiaries, primarily from the Santal community, have been participating in the Community Digital Storytelling project and have recently begun to benefit from the integration of micro-finance initiatives, which have enabled them to purchase livestock and improve their economic conditions.</p>



<p>Chen Zhilin, a representative from Pakistan, received the e-certificates on behalf of the Pakistani microfinance beneficiaries. The Pakistani beneficiaries have been involved in the Cattle Fattening Project, where they have received financing through the YOU Fund to purchase cattle for fattening and selling them at a premium price during the Eid al Adha festival.</p>



<p>As Professor Zhou Deyi awarded the e-certificates to the representatives, he expressed his gratitude and admiration for the hard work and dedication of the beneficiaries. He emphasized that the success of the YOU Fund relies on the collective efforts of the beneficiaries, the local teams managing the funds, and the support of the international community. Professor Zhou also encouraged the beneficiaries to continue their efforts in promoting sustainable development and to share their experiences and knowledge with others in their communities.</p>



<p>The e-certificates served not only as a recognition of the beneficiaries' achievements but also as a symbol of the YOU Fund's commitment to promoting sustainable development through micro-finance initiatives.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Discussion on Sustainability of YOU Fund</strong></h2>



<p>The session concluded with an engaging discussion on the sustainability of the YOU Fund and other micro-finance initiatives. Dr. Amar Razzaq moderated the discussion and invited Professor Zhou Deyi to share his thoughts on how to sustain the YOU Fund over the years, find more donors, and improve performance and the disbursement process.</p>



<p>Professor Zhou acknowledged that the YOU Fund is at a crossroads, with the potential to either grow bigger or diminish and finish once the initial funds are exhausted. He emphasized the importance of having a solid mechanism and good performance to convince potential donors to support the mission. Professor Zhou likened this challenge to the "chicken and egg" dilemma, where it is unclear whether a strong mechanism and good performance should come first to attract more funds, or if more funds are needed to establish a robust system.</p>



<p>Professor Zhou stressed that the managers of the YOU Fund should be passionate entrepreneurs who genuinely love and enjoy the work itself, rather than being solely motivated by financial gain. He believed that this passion and volunteer spirit are preconditions for sustainability, especially in the early stages of the initiative.</p>



<p>Reflecting on his personal journey, Professor Zhou shared his thoughts on the meaning of life and the pursuit of a good life. He expressed his belief that one should strive to have a positive impact on the world, even after their life is over. To simplify the process, Professor Zhou suggested setting milestones for each year, such as the number of beneficiaries and the amount of funding required. He proposed a goal of supporting 10 beneficiaries per year in each country, resulting in 60 cases across three countries within three years, which would provide sufficient samples for a documentary film to showcase the impact and attract more funding.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/weixin-image_20240531173850.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1151" /></figure>



<p>Professor Zhou emphasized the importance of combining micro-finance with e-commerce to find a sustainable way forward. He invited other participants to share their thoughts on the sustainability of micro-finance initiatives.</p>



<p>Professor Geoffrey from Kenya contributed to the discussion by sharing the success story of Equity Bank, which started from a village and has now expanded to multiple countries. He emphasized that the sustainability of micro-finance does not solely depend on the amount of money available but on the management and approach taken. Professor Geoffrey suggested conducting studies to understand the farmers being supported, providing training alongside financial assistance, and focusing on unexploited business opportunities that align with the farmers' interests.</p>



<p>Professor Geoffrey stressed the importance of walking alongside the farmers, learning from them, and ensuring that both parties are moving in the same direction to increase the probability of success. He advocated for a slow and steady approach, taking the time to understand the farmers and building a strong relationship before expanding the initiative.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/weixin-image_20240531175029.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1153" /></figure>



<p>A student, Mohammed Nabil Islam, raised the idea of promoting sustainable, climate-friendly products in Bangladesh, such as jute products, which have been overlooked in recent years. He suggested that micro-finance could be used to support areas that have been producing these products for many years, enabling them to increase production and contribute to a more sustainable future. Mohammed Nabil Islam also inquired about the eligibility criteria and details of the summer school program.</p>



<p>Professor Geoffrey responded by highlighting the potential of combining micro-finance with e-commerce to help farmers access markets beyond their local communities. He shared an example of a student who successfully established a bulking store for green gram and sorghum, finding a market in the Middle East through e-commerce. Professor Geoffrey emphasized that the combination of e-commerce and micro-finance could significantly contribute to the sustainability of these initiatives.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/weixin-image_20240531175515.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1154" /></figure>



<p>Dr. Amar Razzaq addressed Mohammed Nabil Islam's question about the summer school program, confirming that all participants in the forum were eligible to apply. He shared the application requirements, which included submitting personal information, prior experience, and a short business plan or idea. Dr. Amar Razzaq mentioned that the application deadline was June 25th, with results to be announced on July 10th, and the summer school program scheduled from August 5th to August 27th.</p>



<p>Dr. Ali Abderehman from Egypt, an alumnus of Huazhong Agricultural University, contributed to the discussion by suggesting two key points for ensuring the sustainability of micro-finance and cross-border e-commerce initiatives. Firstly, he proposed establishing cooperative working relationships with local partnerships in different countries to create added value, which could be partially allocated to support the sustainability of the business. Secondly, Dr. Ali recommended collaborating with international projects and institutions, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), to secure additional funding and resources for the continuation of the work.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/weixin-image_20240531180410.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1156" /></figure>



<p>Professor Zhou appreciated Dr. Ali's valuable suggestions and requested that he send his ideas to Dr. Amar Razzaq for inclusion in their records.</p>



<p>The discussion on the sustainability of the YOU Fund and micro-finance initiatives provided valuable insights and suggestions from various participants. The key takeaways included the importance of passion and entrepreneurial spirit among the managers, setting clear milestones and goals, combining micro-finance with e-commerce, conducting thorough studies to understand the farmers, providing training alongside financial support, focusing on unexploited business opportunities, collaborating with local partnerships and international institutions, and adopting a slow and steady approach to build strong relationships with the beneficiaries.</p>



<p>The session concluded with a shared commitment to ensuring the sustainability of the YOU Fund and other micro-finance initiatives, recognizing the potential for these projects to create a lasting, positive impact on the lives of small-scale farmers and entrepreneurs in developing countries.</p>
