<h1 class="wp-block-heading">The Spark of an Idea and Bishan Farm Summer Camp</h1>



<p>In hindsight, the genesis could be said to begin with Professor Zhou Deyi’s unique teaching methods as a professor of economics at Huazhong Agricultural University in Wuhan, China.</p>



<p>In the summer of 2016, Professor Zhou led a group of student volunteers to a small farm in rural Suzhou for a summer camp. This was not an ordinary camp; it was the birthplace of a vision. The vision was inspired by the "Farm Worker's Spirit", a philosophy that Professor Zhou had cultivated over the years. The camp was a melting pot of farming, nature, and education, where students were encouraged to get their hands dirty in the soil while also teaching English to primary school students. This humble beginning, which fused practicality and academia, marked the inception of a journey that would lead to the creation of the International Cross-Border E-commerce (CBEC) Forums.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>The Early Moments - Collaging inspirational times at the rural Bishan farm and thought-provoking classroom discussions</em></p>



<p>At the start of 2017, this journey took its first significant step. As a newly enrolled PhD student I increasingly became intrigued by Professor Zhou's unconventional teaching approach. Instead of merely focusing on theoretical aspects, Professor Zhou emphasized the practical application of economics to solve societal challenges. The Professor's unique approach stirred a sense of curiosity and ambition in the students. They were inspired to look beyond their textbooks and imagine the real-world impact they could have.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">First Revelations at Alibaba</h1>



<p>This sense of curiosity was further ignited when Professor Zhou assigned his students a task to study reports from Alibaba Group. Through their exploration of Alibaba's rural Taobao program, the students got a glimpse of how e-commerce was revolutionizing the rural economy in China and reducing poverty. This was the team's first introduction to the power and potential of e-commerce.</p>



<p>By this time, the QQ group of Belt and Road Group for International Students, initiated by Professor Zhou and Li Teng, a prodigy of his, had already been established. The group served as a think-tank where international students from the Belt and Road countries discussed China's technological innovations and their potential global impacts. The group's discussions were instrumental in shaping the team's interest in e-commerce.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>A Pivotal Exposure - Professor Zhou and students gaining valuable first-hand insights during their inaugural visit to Alibaba's headquarters in Hangzhou in 2017</em></p>



<p>In 2017, the team took its first field trip to Alibaba Group's headquarters in Hangzhou, sponsored by Professor Zhou. This visit was a pivotal moment as it provided the students with a first-hand experience of the inner workings of an e-commerce giant and its transformational impacts on rural economies. The exposure to Alibaba's operations and the rural Taobao program greatly enriched the team's understanding of e-commerce.</p>



<p><strong>Crossing Paths with E-Commerce in Mongolia</strong></p>



<p>In 2018, this interest took a more concrete shape when a Master's student, Chimka, from Mongolia chose to study online payment systems for her thesis. This decision set in motion a chain of events that would further shape the team's focus. Professor Zhou, accompanied by Li Teng, Chimka, and Altansukh, another student from Mongolia, visited Mongolia.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Broadening Perspectives - Snippets from Professor Zhou's 2018 visit to Mongolia where he gained cross-border insights by attending a conference and exploring the landscape.</em></p>



<p>The team attended the 60th Anniversary of Mongolia University of Life Sciences and crossed the Er Ling Hao Tan Border City. The journey exposed them to a different perspective on e-commerce and its cross-border potential.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Hands-on Learnings across China</h1>



<p>On their return, the team attended e-commerce training workshops at Huazhong Normal University and in Qingqing. These training sessions deepened their understanding of e-commerce and its implications. The team also visited Gansu province, where they connected with TaoShi, an e-commerce company focusing on alleviating rural poverty. This encounter led to a fruitful cooperation that enabled TaoShi to conduct an e-commerce training session for students at Huazhong Agricultural University.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">The Turning Point</h1>



<p>In 2018, a turning point arrived when Professor Zhou was invited to speak at the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Conference and visit Kashgar's Free Trade Zone. These experiences solidified his focus and led to the realization that it was time to bring together everything the team had learned into a pioneering initiative – the International CBEC Forum.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Laying the Groundwork</h1>



<p>Laying the groundwork for the first forum was a mammoth task. The team, mainly composed of agricultural economists, had to develop an understanding of the local e-commerce scene before they could organize the forum. They undertook surveys of various e-commerce companies in and around Hubei, including numerous Taobao villages. These explorations provided them with a comprehensive understanding of the rural e-commerce scene in Wuhan and the rest of China.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">The First CBEC Forum and Beyond</h1>



<p>In 2018, the first International CBEC Forum was held in Wuhan. The forum, which saw participation from numerous Belt and Road countries, was a resounding success. This success marked the culmination of years of exploration, learning, and hard work.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h1>



<p>The story of the International CBEC Forums is a testament to the power of curiosity, vision, and dedication. It demonstrates how a small spark, when nurtured with the right experiences and efforts, can grow into a powerful force that can revolutionize entire sectors. It is a story of how the vision of one man, coupled with the dedication of a team, led to the birth of a pioneering initiative in the world of e-commerce.</p>
