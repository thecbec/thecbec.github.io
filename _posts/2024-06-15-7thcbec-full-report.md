<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Field visit activities organized by the University of Liberal Arts of Bangladesh</strong></h2>



<p>This started with travel by bus from Dhaka to Pirganj and arriving in Annana hotel in the evening of 1<sup>st</sup> June 2024. The town where the hotel is located is a busy agricultural town and the temperatures are normally high requiring good room conditioning.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1175" style="width:647px;height:auto" /></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-center">M<em>arket where Ananna hotel is located and popular with Litchi production</em></p>



<p>On 2<sup>nd</sup> June we started with a visit to a village in Pirganj area where there are cattle farmers (beneficiaries of Bangladesh Microfinance Project) which was arranged by Dr. Kader Muhammad and facilitated by Mr. Tafshirul Islam from ULAB Media Studies and an official from BRAC Bank. There were two cattle farming communities visited the with the first rearing local low yielding dairy cattle and second rearing high yielding dairy cattle and the third community were producing rice. The Chairlady of the community rearing local low yielding dairy cattle Ms Chandana who had dropped from school due to poverty had earlier been supported by the ULAB microfinance project led by Dr. Kader through purchase of two females which had each calved and therefore there was a total of 4 cattle. In the local low yielding dairy cattle rearing community it was observed that the condition of the animals was not very good as there was little supplementation with off farm feed sources like dairy meal and Napier grass. Consequently, the production per animal was low.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>A member of the community preparing rice straw for hay heaping and the calves of the two granted dairy cows by ULAB microfinance</em></p>



<p>Due to low milk production most of the farmers in this community relied on small scale rice production and being involved in provision of farm labour at 600 Taka per day. It was noted that some women had borrowed money from Grameen Bank ranging from 10000 to 20000 Taka payable within 12 months (1 year) which was mainly used for family livelihood but not starting business. the earning from the community which ranged upto about 20000 Taka per month was used to repay the loan form Grameen bank and therefore there was no default of the repayment which was repaid at 10% and on reducing balance. This community was also observed to use cattle dung for making dung sticks used as fire wood and also had energy saving fire places, and also they conserved rice straw and corn stalks among others in form of cone shaped hay heaps.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Innovative ways of using cattle dung as firewood, using energy saving cooking areas, and storage of hay in cone shaped heaps for use during off-season</em></p>



<p>The rice farming community had rice as the main enterprise and both men and women were involved in the production activities. Rice was planted by hand and harvesting was done manually using a sickle. There exists opportunity to introduce small scale rice planter and harvester by embracing microfinance and e-commerce to procure.</p>

<p>The community keeping high yielding dairy cattle had very beautiful cows and they were supported by BRAC bank which gave them loans to purchase the animals and also they bought the milk from the farmers. The loans ranged from 250000 Taka and was used to strengthen the dairy enterprise. One dairy animal was producing upto 25-30 litres of milk per day. The cattle were also housed in well-constructed and maintained structures.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Meeting and later dinner with Prof. Mohammad Jahangir Alam</em></p>



<p class="has-contrast-color has-text-color has-link-color">On 4<sup>th</sup> of June, the day started with seminar presentations whcich was chaired by the Dean of the Faculty of Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology Professor <a href="https://aers.bau.edu.bd/profile/STAT1006">Khandaker Md. Mostafizur Rahman</a>. There were three presentations made as follows:</p>



<p>Professor Zhou Deyi gave an exciting presentation entiteled “Ecommerce logic, Chinese Ecommerce development and cooperation between China and B&amp;R countries” there were highlights about the cost of production model which revealed that the production cost for most enterprises is 30% and the transaction cost is 70% and includes the transportation cost, product stock cost, shop staff, window-shopping, face-to-face negotiation, middlemen cost, shop rent and the information cost involves most aspects of the transaction costs (mainly stock cost). The traditional business model the products move from producers to a series of middlemen which inflates the costs. There is therefore need to embrace ecommerce which uses internet and can allow to reach nationwide or worldwide consumers. The benefits of e-commerce are bigger than the costs of e-commerce. An example can be drawn from the Chinese Rural E-commerce Development example the Alibaba, Shentong, Zhongtong, Yuantong, Baishihuitong, Yunda, Shunfeng among others. Internet influencers with multiple functions like providing public knowledge (quality and price), quality control, and collective bargaining to ease the decision-making for consumers. Therefore there exists huge opportunities to co-operate between China and Bangladesh.</p>



<p>Esrat Jahan a Lecturer in the Department of Agribusiness and Marketing, Bangladesh Agricultural University on behalf of Esrat Jahan, Md. Moniruzzaman, Dr. Sarah Yasmin and Abu Hayat Md. Saiful Islam also gave a presentation entitled “E-commerce and Consumers’ Satisfaction: Empirical evidence from Digital Marketing System of mango in Bangladesh” that highlighted on how farmers and traders can use ecommerce to reduce postharvest losses of mango. The presentation indicated that customer satisfaction, loyalty and trust are the key factors for long-term profitability, growth and sustainability of any business. Despite the rapid growth and popularity of the e-commerce, still this sector face difficulty in gaining customer satisfaction and trust particularly developing countries.  Similarly, e-commerce in Bangladesh is an emerging sector and agro-based ecommerce is still young and expanded particularly during COVID pandemic.  This study aimed to examine the digital marketing system of mango and factors influencing consumers’ satisfaction towards purchasing of mango through digital platform. A total of 145 consumers from all over the country, who have already purchased mango through digital platforms, and 60 digital mango sellers were selected from Rajshahi and Chapainawabganj districts by using a convenience sampling technique for the study. Data were collected from the consumers with the help of an e-questionnaire of Google Forms sent via email, Facebook, and Messenger. Face-to-face interviews and phone calls were applied to collect data from the digital sellers of mango to examine the digital marketing system of mango with the help of flow chart and descriptive statistics. Ordered logistic regression model was used to analyze the consumers’ satisfaction of purchasing mango through e-commerce. Producers were found as digital sellers in the study areas and digital consumers bought about 23 per cent mango from this type of mango producers. Buying from producers by digital sellers and selling it directly ecommerce to consumers was the most prominent channel. One fully digital mango marketing channel was found and that was producer-cum-digital seller to consumers and other channels are mixed marketing. Most of the sellers (99 percent) used courier service for transporting mango with plastic crate (98 percent) to consumers. About 83 percent digital sellers practiced grading of mango based on size and quality. Prior experience of online shopping, convenience shopping, quality of mango and quality of packaging are the positive and significant predictors of consumers’ satisfaction on mango ecommerce. It was observed that whereas, education had a significant negative impact on the consumers’ satisfaction. Consumers of the highest level of income group are more likely to be highly satisfied than those in the lower income groups. Prior experience of online shopping, convenience shopping, quality of mango, and quality of packaging has positive impact on the higher level of consumers’ satisfaction..</p>



<p>Further, professor Geofrey Gathungu also gave a presentation on microfinance progress in Kenya.  He started by introducing Chuka University and stated it is a public university which was chartered in January 2013. The university is about 200 kilometres from Nairobi city and is located on the slopes of Mt. Kenya. The university has nine faculties including the Faculty of Agriculture, Faculty of Environmental Studies and Resources Development, Faculty of Science and Technology, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, Faculty of Business Studies, Faculty of Education and Resources Development, School of Law and School of Nursing and Public Health. A highlight on the role microfinance can play in assisting small-scale farmers was done. The emphasis was that in Kenya agriculture is a key driver of poverty alleviation in form of providing employment, income generation, GDP growth, foreign exchange earnings, and food security. Smallholder farmers are crucial contributors to agricultural and economic development in developing countries hence their access to credit is a top priority where agriculture is the primary economic activity. However, agricultural productivity is lagging behind due to poor financing especially to the small-scale farmers. Microcredit provides opportunities for rural households to acquire agricultural inputs like seeds, fertilisers, post-harvesting technologies. Professor Geofrey Gathungu emphasized that there is need to support farmers through microfinance but there is need to adequately train the farmers and take advantage to understand them especially their areas of interest. A misdirected and hurried microfinance is a lost opportunity to uplift the farmers. This therefore calls for patience to understand the farmer priorities, preferences, and culture before committing with them in a microfinance project, Professor Geofrey Gathungu spelt out the lessons learnt while working with the farmers in fruit tree agroforestry initiatives which includes; working with and not for the farmer, collaboration between different stakeholders, using microfinance to buy farmers inputs like small agricultural machinery, understanding the farmers culture, involving the government to come up with favourable policies, having flexible microfinance repayment schedules and training the farmers to unlock their thinking among other things.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-cyan-blue-color has-text-color has-link-color"><strong>Field activities at BAU</strong></h2>



<p>After the seminar on 4<sup>th</sup> of June, there was touring of university facilities which included;</p>



<p><strong>Rice production:</strong> this was a BAU farm rice production enterprise. They were involved in rice seed production which was sold by the university to the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Unit for packaging and sale to farmers or the Bagladesh Institute of Nuclear Agriculture for further research as inbred lines. The rice enterprise department has various tools and equipments including planters, sprayers, combine harvester, thresher/cleaner among others that are used to increase on the efficiency of production.</p>

<p><strong>Livestock production enterprise:</strong> this enterprise has about 200 cattle put into different categories and units based on whether in production, dry, incalf or with calf, heifer or calves. All these are fed differently within their well-managed units. It was also observed that the livestock section has some buffaloes that are well tamed. The milk from the milked cows and buffalo is mixed. There was also a milk processing area and a laboratory and class room for graduate students in dairy science. The animals were fed with both fodder grass, hay and concentrates.</p>

<p><strong>Visit to Grameen Bank: The team visited grameen bank a microcredit organization started in 1976 as a pilot research group in </strong>"Jobra" village in Chattogram district of Bangladesh and . t was transformed into a bank in 1983 with the aim of alleviating poverty and empowering the women in Bangladesh through micro-credit. During the visit the team received testimony from members and one of the loanee started with borrowing 10,000BDT and at the time of the visit a loan of 300000 BDT was being processed for her. The bank gives loan at 10% per annum on reducing balance. The highest loanee had received 1,500,000BDT. Farmers were using the loan to strengthen farming including purchase of small agricultural machines like thresher. The members also benefited from scholarship and stipend for their children in college. It was noted that all banking transactions except loan disbursement are done in the meetings of the borrowers at the village level centers organized by the center managers.
